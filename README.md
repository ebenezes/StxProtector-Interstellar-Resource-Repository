# StxProtector - Interstellar Digital Resource Repository

**StxProtector** is a secure and decentralized protocol built on the Stacks blockchain to manage, transmit, and protect valuable resources. The protocol introduces "chambers" as containers for digital assets, offering several features to ensure resource integrity and enforce secure handling procedures.

## Features

- **Transmission Security**: Secure transmission of digital resources to designated recipients with proper authorization and status checks.
- **Time-Locked Safeguard**: Time-lock resources with unlock codes to ensure they are only accessible after a defined period.
- **Chamber Management**: Extensive support for the creation, modification, and termination of chambers containing digital resources.
- **Multi-Signature Requirements**: Ensure high-value resources are controlled by a multi-signature policy for enhanced security.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect high-value transactions from abuse by applying rate-limiting on transfers.
- **Authorization Tiers**: Implement tiered authorization to regulate access to resources based on various conditions.
- **Secure Timeout Mechanism**: Set fallback mechanisms for resources if a transaction is not completed within a certain timeframe.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StxProtector-Interstellar-Resource-Repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd StxProtector-Interstellar-Resource-Repository
   ```

3. Follow Stacks and Clarity specific setup instructions to deploy and interact with the contract.

## Contract Functions

### 1. `execute-chamber-transmission`
Transmits resources from the originator to the destination based on chamber conditions.

### 2. `apply-time-locked-safeguard`
Apply a time-locked safeguard to a chamber, restricting access until the specified unlock duration has passed.

### 3. `abort-chamber`
Allow the originator to abort a chamber before the resources are transmitted.

### 4. `prolong-chamber-lifespan`
Extend the lifespan of an active chamber by adding additional blocks to its expiration time.

### 5. `collect-expired-chamber`
Retrieve expired resources from a chamber, available only to the originator or admin.

### 6. `establish-multi-signature-requirement`
Set multi-signature requirements for high-value resources to increase security.

### 7. `register-transaction-challenge`
Register a challenge for an ongoing transaction with evidence to back up the claim.

### 8. `apply-rate-limiting`
Protect resources by applying transaction rate-limiting for additional security.

### 9. `implement-tiered-authorization`
Set up tiered access control based on resource value and authorized principals.

### 10. `establish-secure-timeout`
Establish a secure timeout mechanism that redirects assets if not acted upon within a given time period.

## Usage

Once deployed, the contract can be interacted with using Stacks transaction calls or through a DApp interface designed to interact with the StxProtector.

### Example:
To execute a chamber transmission:
```javascript
stxTransaction.send(contract, 'execute-chamber-transmission', [chamberIndex])
```

## Security

- Only the admin user or the originator can initiate critical actions like transmission, aborting, and rate-limiting.
- Multi-signature and tiered authorization mechanisms ensure that high-value resources are subject to multiple approvals.
- Chambers can be time-locked for further security, allowing resources to be safely stored and transferred after a specified period.
